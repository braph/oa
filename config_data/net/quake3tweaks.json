I myself keep this setting on 0 as it speeds up play (around 2-3 FPS) and gives the advantage of not having a gun blocking your view - especialy helpful when using the railgun.

You should either find it too bright or too dark - adjust the gamma accordingly. I have found that setting this setting to 3 results in far more clarity and detail in the textures - before the image was a tad \"smudged\" but now the detail the designers put in the game is more apparent than ever!!

If it has bouncing yellow spikes then your display will stutter and be more difficult to view. To combat this, first ensure you have followed my tweaking techniques and then change your snaps setting. Usually, this means lowering it by 1 or 2 until your screen is stable and you have a nice flowing blue line in your lagometer. The second line shows if packets are being recieved from the server. This should be green. If it is yellow or red, try increasing your rate or try lowering your snaps.

I have heard people set this to plus what your ping is (say 100) but this reacted badly when I was playing on-line. If you cannot find a decent setting then leave it at default (0). Use this in conjunction with the lagometer for best results. Remember, plus means you will get a slower response and minus means the computer will try to predict what your next move is in an attempt to reduce lag - this can cause anomalities to occur. However, I would not recommend setting either number higher than 100."
